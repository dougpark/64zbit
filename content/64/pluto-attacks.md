"The Plutonians are not happy with us calling their home a 'dwarf' planet. So when they discovered a trick in the space time continuum they sent an infinite number of drones to attack Earth. We created an energy weapon that can siphon off the energy from the drones weapons. This powers the Earths vessel and creates a powerful energy shield. Remember, don't let even one alien escape!"

Poving Games released this intense shooter based on the classic Phaser Invaders example and then taken it into complete overdrive! You don't have to shoot, that is done automatically. You just move left and right and blast away the plutonains. It all starts quite calmly and you'll no doubt do a perfect clearance of the first few levels.

### How To Play

You can start at Normal level 1 if you want to see how it all began. Typical space game with normal dodge and shoot action. You can even level up to the 20’s and still play a dodge and shoot game. However, it will drive you crazy and you will get bored.

The fun begins at about Fun level 20. Everything is faster and you quickly realize there is more to the game then just dodge and shoot. In fact dodging is no longer possible. There are explosions, lots and lots of explosions.

Plutonians are not happy with the reclassification of their home world to Dwarf Planet. So when they discovered a trick in the space time continuum they send an infinite number of drones to attack Earth. Earth learned just enough about their technology to use it to their own advantage. We created an energy weapon that can siphon off the energy from the drones weapons. This powers the Earth vessel and creates a powerful energy shield.

For desktop just press the space bar to start and then left and right arrows to move. That’s it.

For mobile just tap to start and then use your finger to move back and forth. It’s actually easier and more fun on mobile.

Levels go by pretty quickly. Hey, it’s a game with only two buttons and you can master it in 60 seconds. By level 20 it’s moving right along and by level 30 it’s actually pretty good. Have Fun!

Tip: Don’t let any aliens escape!
