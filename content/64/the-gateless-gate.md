> "This classic Zen Buddhist collection of 49 koans with commentary by Mumon was originally published in 1934, and later included in Paul Reps and Nyogen Senzaki's popular anthology Zen Flesh, Zen Bones. Due to non-renewal it is currently in the public domain in the US (although other parts of Zen Flesh, Zen Bones are not)." [source link](https://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/glg/index.htm)

I was playing with CSS and Html and made a nice little web app.
